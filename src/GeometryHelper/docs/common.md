# Shared types

What both halves of the library are measured and described with: `Tolerance`, `Angle`, the
enumerations, `OffsetOptions`, and `GeometryHelperLog`. They sit at the root of the `GeometryHelper`
namespace, so one `using GeometryHelper;` brings them all in.

They know nothing about any particular shape, which is why one `Tolerance` and one `Angle` serve
[the plane](plane.md), [space](solid.md) and [label placement](arrange.md) alike.

## Tolerance

Every comparison in either library that can be affected by floating point error takes a `Tolerance`,
and every such method has an overload without one that reads `Tolerance.Global`. Neither library
compares coordinates with `==`.

| Threshold | Default | Measures |
|---|---|---|
| `EqualPoint` | `1E-4` | Distance below which two points are the same point. |
| `EqualVector` | `1E-4` | Difference below which two vectors are the same vector. |
| `EqualAngleRad` | 1° | Angular difference for parallel and perpendicular tests. |
| `EqualPlanar` | `1E-4` | Distance from a plane below which a point counts as lying on it. |

`EqualPlanar` is separate from `EqualPoint` because coplanarity is measured far from the reference
point. A face twelve metres long that is tilted by a hundredth of a degree deviates by about two
millimetres at its far end — far more than `EqualPoint` allows, yet still flat enough to work with.
Only the solid half of the library uses it.

```csharp
// One setting for both libraries.
Tolerance.Global = new Tolerance(equalPoint: 1E-3, equalVector: 1E-3);

// Or pass one explicitly, which is what to do when a single operation needs to be looser or
// tighter than the rest of the program.
bool same = first.IsEqualTo(second, new Tolerance(1E-6, 1E-6));
```

`Tolerance.Global` is a single shared setting. Changing it for a drawing in the plane changes it for
a model in space as well.

## Angle

An angle stored in radians and readable as either unit. There is deliberately no public constructor
taking a bare double: a number on its own does not say which unit it is in, so the unit is named at
the point of creation.

```csharp
Angle right = Angle.FromDegrees(90.0);
double radians = right.Radians;          // 1.5707963...

Angle turned = right + Angle.FromDegrees(300.0);
Angle wrapped = turned.Normalize();       // into [0, 2π)
Angle signed  = turned.NormalizeSigned(); // into (-π, π]
```

`Normalize` and `NormalizeSigned` differ in where they put the cut: the first is what to use for a
bearing, the second for a difference between two directions, where -170° is a nearer answer than
190°.

## PointLocation

Where a point sits relative to a shape: `Inside`, `OutSide`, or `OnSide`.

What counts as `Inside` depends on the family the shape belongs to. A volume encloses a region of
space. A region encloses an area — in space that means a point counts as inside only when it lies on
the carrier plane as well as within the boundary. A curve encloses nothing and never reports
`Inside`.

## PlaneSide

Which side of an oriented plane a point lies on: `Above`, `Below`, or `On`. The sides are named after
the plane normal rather than after world up, because a plane carries its own orientation and may
point anywhere.

## LineEnd

Which end of a segment an extend, trim or lengthen operation moves: `Start` or `End`. A segment runs from
its start point to its end point, so its two ends are told apart by that order rather than by position.
The end that is not named stays where it is, and the segment never turns round.

## LineSide

Which side of a directed segment a point lies on: `Left`, `Right` or `On`, seen looking along the segment
from its start to its end. It is the counterpart in the plane of `PlaneSide` in space, and a segment is
read as the infinite line carrying it, so a point beyond either end still has a side.

## LineExtension

Which of two segments an intersection may reach past, by reading it as the infinite line carrying it:
`None`, `First` (the segment the method is called on), `Second` (the argument) or `Both`. A segment that is
not extended has to contain the intersection itself, within tolerance; an extended one only has to point at
it, however far away. This is what the `Intersect` option does for AutoCAD's `IntersectWith`.

## OffsetJoin

How an offset closes the gap that opens at a corner, where the two offset edges pull apart — at a convex
corner when a region grows, at a concave one when it shrinks. On the inside of a turn the offset edges
overlap instead and are cut where they meet, whatever the join. The three kinds are AutoCAD's offset gap
types.

| `OffsetJoin` | Corner | OFFSETGAPTYPE |
|---|---|---|
| `Miter` | the offset edges carried on until they meet | 0, Extend |
| `Round` | an arc about the original vertex, drawn as chords | 1, Fillet |
| `Chamfer` | one segment square to the corner's bisector, at the offset distance | 2, Chamfer |

## OffsetOptions

The join together with the two numbers that bound it. It is immutable, so one instance can be kept as a
setting and shared between threads.

```csharp
OffsetOptions sharp = OffsetOptions.Default;                              // Miter, limit 10, arcs automatic
var cut    = new OffsetOptions(OffsetJoin.Miter, miterLimit: 2.0);        // sharp corners cut off past 2 x d
var always = new OffsetOptions(OffsetJoin.Miter, double.PositiveInfinity);// no corner is ever cut off
var round  = new OffsetOptions(OffsetJoin.Round, arcTolerance: 0.5);      // chords within 0.5 of the arc
```

| Property | Default | Means |
|---|---|---|
| `Join` | — | Which of the three corners to build. |
| `MiterLimit` | `10` | How far a sharp corner may reach from its vertex, as a multiple of the offset distance; past it the corner is cut off square at that distance. At least 1, and 10 keeps every corner of 11.5° or wider sharp. |
| `ArcTolerance` | `0` | The largest gap allowed between a round corner's chords and the true arc, in drawing units. Zero means 0.2 % of the offset distance, about 50 segments for a full turn. |

`GetArcTolerance(distance)` gives the gap a round corner is actually drawn to, which is where that 0.2 %
is resolved. Each number is ignored by the joins it does not apply to — a `Round` join never reads
`MiterLimit` — but equality compares all three regardless, so two sets that would offset alike are not
necessarily equal.

The offsets themselves are in the two geometry libraries; these types only say what they should do.

## GeometryHelperLog

Where the GeometryHelper libraries report what they left out or could not do. Conversions that walk many
objects skip what they cannot read rather than throw, so that one bad object does not cost the rest;
`GeometryHelperLog` says what was skipped and why, which is how an empty or short result gets explained.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GeometryHelper;

// Messages go to System.Diagnostics.Trace, category "GeometryHelper", unless a writer is set: the Output
// window of Visual Studio shows them while debugging, and DebugView shows them from a plugin.
GeometryHelperLog.Writer = (level, message, exception) =>
    File.AppendAllText(@"C:\Temp\geometryhelper.log",
                       GeometryHelperLog.Format(level, message, exception) + Environment.NewLine);

GeometryHelperLog.Enable = false;   // nothing is written; true by default
```

| Method | Level | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `GeometryHelperLog.Debug` | `Debug` | Something skipped for an expected reason: a reference model that is not IFC, a GlobalId the file does not hold |
| `GeometryHelperLog.Info` | `Info` | The outcome of a call, such as how many products were converted |
| `GeometryHelperLog.Warn` | `Warn` | Something left out because it failed: a file that cannot be read, a body that cannot be rebuilt |
| `GeometryHelperLog.Err` | `Err` | A failure the caller should know about |

- Each method takes the message and, optionally, the exception behind it. `GeometryHelperLog.Format` gives the text the
  default writer uses, for example `WARN The IFC file cannot be read. [IOException: The file is in use.]`.
- Writing never throws: a writer that fails is ignored, so logging cannot break the work it reports on.
- `Enable` and `Writer` are shared by the whole process, like `Tolerance.Global`: set them once at start-up.
